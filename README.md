  ### Description

 The project uses an API from MapBox, which is similar to Google Maps but much more customizable. I added in a login page, and created a new location page as well as a view history page of added locations/descriptions. I used Materialize for the design features, Mongo DB for the database, a boiler plate for the routes, React.js components, Express, CSS, NPM Turf (additional styling for Mapbox), and NPM multer (in order to upload photos into Mongo DB).

 I present to you a travel blog materialized in the form of your personal online passport. You can add photos, past trips, and details about a certain restaurant or experience during your trip, and you can share amongst family and friends. I added a map which can show you where your friends or family have visited. Another feature would include trip planning.

  ### User Story

  * AS an avid traveller I WANT to be able to plan ahead to have the best possible trip and I want to share that experience with family and friends.
